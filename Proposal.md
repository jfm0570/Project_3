				Project 3 Proposal
Team Byte Breakers: David Kauffman, Dennys Urdiales, Elizabeth Lawal, Jenipher Flores-Martinez

Summary
In Project 3, our team will collect and analyze data to explore this summer’s weather record for the US. The summer of 2023 has officially been marked by various climate-tracking organizations as the hottest summer in history. Our project will give a clear view of daily weather conditions in 12 cities across the US over the course of 3 months (May - July 2023). We will look at daily temperatures, precipitation, and UV levels by mapping our data and creating applicable charts representing this year’s weather.
